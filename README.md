## Project Purpose:
<br><br>

This project will collect feature data from the Spotify API from my highest streamed songs songs and the highest streamed songs of friends with different musical preferences and compute the averages of each feature. With that data, I will then analyze randomly selected playlists to find songs that are close to my averages. This will test the accuracy of the algorithm. Then I will pull songs
from popular or emerging song catalogs (ex: Billboard Top 100), find their Spotify features and recommend the songs with the closest
averages to my average
